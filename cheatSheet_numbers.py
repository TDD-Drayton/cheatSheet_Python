int(1.5) #result is 1
float(2) #result is 2.0
#Numbers - useful functions
abs(5) #the distance between the number in between parantheses and 0
abs(-5) #returns the same result as abs(5)
max(1, 2) #returns the largest number
min(1, 2) #returns the smallest number
pow(3, 2) #another way of raising to a power
